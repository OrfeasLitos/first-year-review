\subsection{Modelling for Decentralised E-Commerce}
  The main aim of this research is to construct a model that closely follows the dynamics
  of a marketplace. Following the Universal Composability framework, we define $n$
  interactive Turing Machines (ITMs) that represent the players that take part in the
  marketplace game. These ITMs comprise the set $\mathcal{P}$. Furthermore, we define an
  ITM named Environment and represented by $\mathcal{E}$.
  
  This ITM is the first to start functioning. Initially, its responsibility is to allocate
  a utility function to each player, drawn from a distribution on legal utility functions
  that is common knowledge \cite{knowledge} to the players. We will elaborate on the
  nature of the utility functions later on. Additionally, $\mathcal{E}$ provides players
  with an initial ``endowment'' of assets and money. Contrary to the utility functions,
  these are not sent only to the players, but additionally to the
  $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Assets}}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Ledger}}$ functionalities
  respectively.
  
  After providing the utility functions and the endowments, the main part of the game
  begins. $\mathcal{E}$ can send a message to a player $P \in \mathcal{P}$ that contains a
  desire $d$ to be satisfied. To satisfy this desire, $P$ has to buy it from another
  player.
