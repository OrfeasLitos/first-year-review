\subsection{Research on Payment Channels}
  In this part of the research we have mainly focused on understanding the general
  framework within which the various realisations of payment channels can be classified,
  compared and evaluated. To achieve this, we reviewed the relevant literature, which has
  rapidly grown to be quite extensive and contains both concrete
  systems~\cite{abunchofthings} and attempts for the formalisation of payment
  channels~\cite{statechannels}. Section~\ref{sec:literaturereview} provides a summary of
  the field.
