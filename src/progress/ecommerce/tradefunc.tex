\subsubsection{$\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Trade}}$} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  This functionality attempts to abstract away the details of how a trade takes place once
  Alice has decided to buy from Bob. It checks that Alice indeed has the necessary coins
  and pays Bob. Then it asks Bob whether to proceed with transferring the agreed asset or
  cheat and acts accordingly.

  This functionality does the ``plumbing'' of the system and is not central to the design.
  We have chosen to keep this functionality simple, so it does not make any important
  decisions; it simply executes a trade according to the wishes of the involved parties.
  We have provided a protocol $\Pi_{\mathrm{Trade}}$ that realises the functionality. We
  have not yet proved that the latter indeed realises the former, but we will certainly do
  so in the future.
