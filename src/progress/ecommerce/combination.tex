\subsubsection{Putting it all together} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  Our current approach is as follows: In the real world, each player may follow any
  protocol. At an arbitrary moment in time $\mathcal{E}$ stops the game and evaluates the
  utility functions of all the players. This way we do not restrict the players to
  optimization protocols. We will attempt to find specific protocols that achieve
  desirable properties. More specifically, our main concern is to find a protocol that
  realises $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{SAT}}$. It may make sense to leverage previous
  work~\cite{rationalprotocol} to argue on the extent to which such a protocol constitutes
  a Nash Equilibrium, but the correct approach in this respect is not yet clear. We will
  further discuss future work in Section~\ref{sec:plan}.
