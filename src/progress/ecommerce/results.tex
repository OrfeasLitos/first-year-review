  Let $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$ be an alternative trust functionality that simply
  chooses a vendor at random. We have proved that there exists an Environment that can
  provide suitable utility functions and initiate a trade such that it always
  distinguishes whether it is interacting with the real-world protocol
  $\Pi_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ or with the ideal-world functionality $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$.
  This proof confirmed our intuition that the trust functionality is of crucial importance
  if we wish to realise $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$.
