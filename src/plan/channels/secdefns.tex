\subsubsection{Security definitions and design} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  After having established our model, a series of security definitions should be given to
  account for the various desirable properties of specific payment channels. Similarly to
  the previous step, these definitions will be inspired by the concrete payment channel
  constructions. Furthermore, we will attempt to prove (or disprove) the security
  properties of individual designs. This process will gradually begin when our model
  starts taking a more definitive form and will hopefully be completed in the next 5 to 7
  months.

  We will then move on to the most important stage of this research, namely to attempt to
  create one or more concrete payment channel systems that attain specific goals in an
  optimal manner. A complementary goal is to identify incompatible properties and prove
  the exact reasons why it is impossible to create a system that enjoys all of them.
