\subsection{E-Commerce}
  Our model for reputation in e-commerce is still incomplete. As already mentioned, we
  have to prove that $\Pi_{\mathrm{Trade}}$ UC-realises $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Trade}}$.
  This will not be hard to prove, but we have chosen to defer this proof to a later point
  in time because it is still likely that the details of both the protocol and the
  functionality will change.
