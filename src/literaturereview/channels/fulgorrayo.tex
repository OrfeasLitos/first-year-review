\subsubsection{Concurrency and Privacy with Payment-Channel Networks} \
\\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  This work~\cite{fulgorrayo} focuses on issues arising when considering routing of
  payments through existing networks of payment channels. In contrast to other
  applications that assume the path that a multi-hop payment will follow is known in
  advance, this paper proposes a way to decide which path to use for payments given a
  particular network topology. In particular it proposes two intimately related routing
  mechanisms, Fulgor and Rayo. The first provides better privacy guarantees but is prone
  to deadlocks while routing, in which case time and mining fees are wasted. On the other
  hand, Rayo enforces non-blocking progress at the expense of lower privacy guarantees.
  Importantly, an impossibility result is provided, ruling out a system that provides both
  privacy and non-blocking progress. This system can be deployed on bitcoin, since it uses
  simple HTLC contracts.
