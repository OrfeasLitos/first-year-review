\subsubsection{Sprites} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  Sprites~\cite{sprites} constitute an improvement upon Lightning regarding the worst-case
  time needed to settle in case of a dispute. This construction needs general-purpose
  smart contracts to be implemented. Consider a channel of $l$ hops, where $\Delta$ is the
  time given to each participant to publish their state after a counterparty has
  unilaterally broadcast theirs. The worst-case time to settle in the case of Lightning is
  $\Theta\left(l\Delta\right)$, whereas in Sprites it is $\Theta\left(l + \Delta\right)$.

  To achieve this, this system uses a smart contract called Preimage Manager, which is
  used only in case of dispute and keeps track of published preimages. A player that wants
  to settle on-chain has to broadcast the preimage instead of just sending it to the next
  hop of the multi-hop channel and thus all subsequent players can use this preimage to
  retrieve their funds, thus obviating the need of a $\Theta\left(\Delta\right)$ timeout
  for each hop.
