\subsubsection{Teechan} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  Teechan~\cite{teechan} achieves off-chain payments with superior speed, lower latency
  with fewer messages per transaction compared to other systems and only two on-chain
  transactions for the entire channel lifetime. It achieves such improvements by
  leveraging Intel SGX, which is a trusted execution enclave present in modern Intel
  processors~\cite{intelsgx}. This is a stronger but reasonable assumption that permits
  two parties to securely and efficiently execute the desired code in a remote processor,
  trusting only that Intel has correctly implemented SGX.

  Such a class of assumptions may prove versatile and efficient enough to reliably enable
  realistic and scalable monetary transactions in the future, with Teechan providing an
  influential blueprint, but further researh upon such enclaves is
  needed~\cite{sgxinsufficient,spectresgx}.
