\subsubsection{Payment channels literature: Conclusion} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  The variety of payment channel instantiations and the breadth of their aims underlines
  the abstraction level our model should achieve. Indeed, Perun~\cite{perun} offers
  arbitrary off-chain contracts, Bolt~\cite{bolt} provides strong privacy guarantees and
  ``Concurrency and Privacy with Payment-Channel Networks''~\cite{fulgorrayo} highlights
  central issues in multi-hop payment routing. Ideally our model should be able to capture
  all these dimensions of payment channels and provide a unified vocabulary to facilitate
  the comparison of existing as well as future instantiations of such systems.
