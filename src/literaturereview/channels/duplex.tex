\subsubsection{Payment Network with Duplex Micropayment Channels} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  This work~\cite{duplexchannels} is historically the first payment channel solution. It
  serves as proof-of-concept for the viability of payment channels, but has some
  drawbacks. First of all, it requires a rather high amount of local storage for each
  payment channel. Secondly, the number of possible updates throughout the existence of a
  channel is limited. Nevertheless, this proposal gives valuable insight on the inherent
  tradeoffs in payment channels design.
