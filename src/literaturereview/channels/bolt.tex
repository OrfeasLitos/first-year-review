\subsubsection{Bolt} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  This construction~\cite{bolt} offers an alternative approach that provides stronger
  privacy guarantees. In particular, the proposal consists of two-party unidirectional or
  bidirectional channels where one end of the channel (say Alice) cannot distinguish
  between payments made from or to the various players with which Alice is connected. Thus
  two such bidirectional channels can be combined if Bob wants to pay Charlie through
  Alice in such a way that the transactions do not touch the blockchain and Alice does not
  learn who paid whom. Ideas from e-cash and blind signatures~\cite{blindsignatures} are
  applied in this work.
