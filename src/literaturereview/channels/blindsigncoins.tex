\subsubsection{Blindly signed contracts} \ \\*[0.5\baselineskip]
  Last but not least, this construction~\cite{blindsigncoins} extends solutions like
  Lightning~\cite{lightning} and Duplex Micropayment Channels~\cite{duplexchannels} to add
  anonymity using blindly signed contracts. Their technique is mainly developed for
  on-chain mixing purposes, but is extended to function in the off-chain setting as well.
