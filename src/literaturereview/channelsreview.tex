\subsection{Payment and State Channels}
\label{sec:literaturereview:channels}
  There exists already a considerable body of work related to payment channels. Here we
  will explain relatively thoroughly the Lightning Network~\cite{lightning} in order to
  make clear the basic mechanism. Then we will explain other systems at a higher level and
  compare the different properties, advantages and drawbacks each system has.
