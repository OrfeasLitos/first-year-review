  This research proposal concerns the study of economic trust in the decentralised,
  asynchronous setting and its applications on online commerce and blockchains. In
  particular, the aim of this project twofold. The first goal is to understand whether it
  is possible to achieve robust online commerce with minimal risk of fraud without trusted
  third parties and if so at what cost. The second goal is to provide a general model of
  off-chain payments and explain how a relaxation of the trustless element of current
  solutions can facilitate the creation of a scalable blockchain. Tools from the fields of
  Cryptography and Game Theory will be used to achieve the aforementioned targets.
