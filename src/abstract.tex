  This research proposal concerns the study of the concept of economic trust in the
  decentralised, asynchronous setting and its applications on online commerce and
  blockchains. In particular, the aim of this project twofold. The first goal is to
  understand whether it is possible to achieve robust online commerce with minimal risk of
  fraud without trusted third parties and if so at what cost. The second goal is to
  provide a general model of off-chain payments and explain how a relaxation of the
  trustless element of current solutions can facilitate the creation of a scalable
  blockchain. Tools from the fields of Cryptography and Game Theory are used to achieve
  the aforementioned targets.
