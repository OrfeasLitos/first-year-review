\section{Directions for further work and plan of action}
\label{sec:plan}
  In this section we lay out our plan for further development of our models, known and
  possible hurdles we will have to overcome and a strategy to reroute our research to new,
  related topics in case the current approach does not bear fruit. We give a rough
  schedule of our projected progress at each time frame, along with the incremental
  results that we hope to lead to relevant publications.

  We will treat separately the e-commerce and the payment channels settings, starting from
  the simpler issues and gradually making our way to the most complex (and most
  interesting) ones for each setting.
