\subsection{Off-chain payment channels}
  One additional impediment to the more widespread use of decentralised blockchains is the
  issue of scalability. Decentralised consensus protocols based on
  Proof-of-Work~\cite{hashcash} or Proof-of-Stake~\cite{ouroboros} make the assumption
  that the majority of the hashing power or of the stake respectively is controlled by
  honest parties, each of which processes every single transaction. To oversimplify, one
  can think that such protocols function only as long as every member of a crucial portion
  of their users processes all transactions. A great duplication of effort takes place in
  order to avoid trusting a particular set of users. It seems intuitively obvious that, no
  matter how much the parameters are tuned, such systems can only handle a limited amount
  of transactions per second and thus cannot compete traditional centralised solutions
  such as VISA in their current state~\cite{tps}.

  One solution to this issue is to ensure that most payments happen off-chain.
