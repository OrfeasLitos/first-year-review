\subsection{Off-chain payments}
  One additional impediment to the more widespread use of decentralised blockchains is the
  issue of scalability. Decentralised consensus protocols based on
  Proof-of-Work~\cite{hashcash} or Proof-of-Stake~\cite{ouroboros} make the assumption
  that the majority of the hashing power or of the stake respectively is controlled by
  honest parties, each of which processes every single transaction. To oversimplify, one
  can think that such protocols function only as long as a crucial portion of their users
  processes all transactions. It seems intuitively obvious that, no matter how much the
  parameters are tuned, such systems can only handle a limited amount of transactions per
  second and thus cannot compete traditional centralised solutions such as VISA as
  such~\cite{tps}.

  One solution to this issue is to ensure that most payments happen off-chain.
